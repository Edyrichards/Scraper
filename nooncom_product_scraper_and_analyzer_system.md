**Date:** June 22, 2025
**Status:** Completed & Delivered

---

### **1. Project Overview**

This document marks the formal handover of the **Noon.com Product Scraper & Analyzer** application. The project's primary objective was to develop a comprehensive system capable of scraping product data from Noon.com, enriching it through AI-powered image classification, and presenting the aggregated data in an interactive, user-friendly analytics dashboard.

The final application successfully meets these goals, providing a powerful tool for market analysis and data visualization. It operates via a simple user interface where a Noon.com URL is submitted, triggering a robust backend process that handles scraping, data processing, classification, and storage, with results dynamically updated and displayed on the dashboard.

### **2. Key Features**

The application is delivered with the following core features fully implemented:

*   **URL-Based Scraping:** Users can initiate a data collection task simply by pasting a Noon.com product or category URL into the main interface.
*   **Asynchronous Job Processing:** Heavy-duty tasks like scraping and AI classification are handled in the background using Celery and Redis. This ensures the UI remains responsive and provides a seamless user experience.
*   **AI-Powered Product Classification:** The system integrates OpenAI's CLIP model to analyze product images. It automatically classifies items based on:
    *   Main Category (e.g., *Clothing*, *Shoes*, *Electronics*)
    *   Visual Attributes (e.g., *Color*, *Material*, *Pattern*)
    *   Occasion (e.g., *Casual*, *Formal*, *Sport*)
    *   Sub-types (e.g., *T-Shirt*, *Sneakers*, *Backpack*)
*   **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** A rich, client-side dashboard visualizes the scraped data, featuring:
    *   Dynamic charts for category distribution and price range analysis.
    *   A filterable and sortable grid view of all collected products.
*   **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Chart.js to render clear, responsive bar charts that provide at-a-glance insights into the product catalog.
*   **Robust Data Management:** Includes a data processing pipeline for cleaning, standardizing, and persisting product information in an SQL database via SQLAlchemy.

### **3. Technology Stack**

The application is built on a modern, scalable technology stack, designed for performance and maintainability.
